In a previous blogpost we managed to manually create a simple VPC that could host several services or traditionnal [EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/).
This process was quite simple using the AWS console as it would deploy all the network construct within a VPC (Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateways etc...)

I have been deploying network infrastructure (NSX, Cumulus, Cisco ...) for the past few years using [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/network-infrastructure-as-code.html) and naturally I will show you how to deploy networking cloud constructs related to AWS (not only !) using [Terraform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform).

First, Terraform will need a way to authenticate with AWS (covered in this [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs), this [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) is also very valuable). 

There are plenty of examples on the Internet for this but the official terraform aws module is quite [complete](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest), it points to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/master/examples/complete-vpc) that is very well presented and easy to follow.

My code for this particular deployment is very simple:


``` bash

provider "aws" {
  shared_config_files      = ["/Users/nmichel/.aws/config"]
  shared_credentials_files = ["/Users/nmichel/.aws/credentials"]
  #profile                  = "default"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

locals {
  name   = "AWS-UE1-VPC-MGMT"
  region = "us-east-1"
  tags = {
    Owner       = "Nicolas MICHEL"
    Environment = "IT Services"
    #Name        = "AWS-UE1-VPC-MGMT"
  }
}


module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.14.2"
  name = "AWS-UE1-VPC-MGMT"
  cidr = "10.0.10.0/24"

  azs             = ["${local.region}a", "${local.region}b"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.10.96/28", "10.0.10.112/28"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.10.0/28", "10.0.10.16/28"]

  enable_nat_gateway = false
  enable_vpn_gateway = false

  manage_default_route_table = true
  default_route_table_tags   = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }


  tags = local.tags
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "SG-vPackets-MGMT"
  description = "Allow SSH/HTTPS inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id
  #vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH from VPC"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["YOUR_IP"]
    #ipv6_cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.ipv6_cidr_block]
  }
  ingress {
    description      = "TLS from VPC"
    from_port        = 443
    to_port          = 443
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["YOUR_IP"]
    #ipv6_cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.ipv6_cidr_block]
  }

  egress {
    from_port        = 0
    to_port          = 0
    protocol         = "-1"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "SG-vPackets-MGMT"
  }
}

```


Same as previously it will create a simple VPC in 10 seconds and will allow me to install all my EC2 instances workloads. The only difference here is that I have included a Security Group that will allow inbound SSH and TLS traffic into EC2 instances linked with that Security Group. (please include your IP in the security group).

``` bash 
$ terraform plan         

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.

Once you are ready to commit your configuration:

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following

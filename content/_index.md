# Welcome to my blog

Welcome to vPackets.net !  The purpose of this blog is to share my experience regarding the diversify subjects that I am passionate about. Networking has been very static at the begining of my career and I can't believe the number of current innovations in our industry right now.

# Who am I ?

My name is Nicolas MICHEL. I am a french networking engineer and expatriate

I have spent 15 years in the IT industry and I primarily focus on networking (Data Center – Enterprise Campus – WAN) and Unified Communications. After focusing on traditionnal networking  I realized that our industry was completely shifting to new frameworks and ways to deliver technological outcomes that would answer some business challenges that companies are struggling with. I decided to stay a networking expert but with a focus on Automation and Devops.

I have designed and implemented several networking solutions for my customers with either a local or international presence.

I have 3 wonderful kids and we live with my wife in Austin, TX. I am an ex national swimmer with a desperate love for endurance sports. I am training for Ironman races. I also enjoy photography, movies and MMORPGs from time to time.

# What do I do and who do I work for?

I had the privilege to experience multiple roles in my career. I have been delivering networking solutions, act as a solution architect. Recently I have been a Technical Product Manager (Technical marketing engineer) at VMware in charge of the layer 3 features of NSX and a Principal product manager at Aviatrix. I was working on the layer 3 features as well of Aviatrix.

- Understand new use cases to be addressed in the  platform by developing deep technical relationships with the  customers and field teams, and by maintaining a broad understanding of the cloud networking market.
- Design new, excitingnetworking features that address these use cases.  Partner with the engineering team to validate the feasibility and the development effort.  Identify tradeoffs when necessary.
- Follow the feature during the coding and testing phase to ensure that the implementation is aligned with the requirements.
- Work with key customers prior to the release with the Customer Preview Program.
- Launch the feature externally by collaborating with the product marketing and technical marketing groups.
- Monitor the customer feedback and continuously improve the feature after the launch.
- Provide technical and architectural expertise for the feature to customers and field teams.
- Deliver roadmap sessions to customers.

It rewards particularly honourable service rendered by military personnel for their participation in operational activities.
